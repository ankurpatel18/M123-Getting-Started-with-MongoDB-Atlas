You may find the following example string useful when connecting to your instance:

mongorestore --host m123final-shard-00-00-cl0rt.mongodb.net --port 27017 --authenticationDatabase admin --ssl --username admin --password PASSWORD final-exam-mongodump/


mongo mongodb://m123final-shard-00-00-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123final-shard-00-01-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123final-shard-00-02-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017/admin?replicaSet=m123Final-shard-0 --ssl --username admin --password PASSWORD


The value of the messages field will be a string. Please input the string below. Be sure to include the quotation marks around the string, but no other part of the document. For instance, if the document were:

{ "_id" : "message-from-will", "message" : "This is the correct answer." }
