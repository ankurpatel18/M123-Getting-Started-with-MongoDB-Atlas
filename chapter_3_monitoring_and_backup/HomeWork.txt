Homework: Lab: Create Alerts


Before beginning this lab, please create a three-node replica set cluster in Atlas using M10s with the default settings.

Once your cluster is ready, create the following alerts:

alert 1: alert by email if Opcounter: Insert increases above 300 (avg/sec)
alert 2: alert by email if DB Storage grows beyond 100MB
alert 3: alert by email if Opcounter: Query increases above 300 (avg/sec)
Once these alerts have been created, download the handout, unzip and run the script atlas_lab_create_alerts.js. You may use the following as an example of how to run this script. Make sure the user you specify has read and write access to the test database.

mongo mongodb://m123-alerts-shard-00-00-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123-alerts-shard-00-01-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123-alerts-shard-00-02-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017/admin?replicaSet=M123-Alerts-shard-0 --ssl --username admin --password PASSWORD --quiet atlas_lab_create_alerts.js

After the script has run for a few minutes, you should see an alert notice in Atlas. The user you've set up as owner for your Atlas group should also receive email notification. Which of the following alerts was triggered by the script? Please terminate the cluster when you have completed this lab.



Ans : alert 1

Homework: Lab: Backup and Restore

In this lab, we will perform a backup operation on a cluster, and then restore it to a point-in-time chosen by us after one particular operation.

Begin by creating a three-node replica set cluster in Atlas using M10s with the default settings.

Once your cluster is ready, download the handout, unzip, and run the script atlas_create_backup_data.js. You may use the following as an example of how to run this script. Run this script as the admin user for your cluster.

mongo mongodb://m123-alerts-shard-00-00-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123-alerts-shard-00-01-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017,m123-alerts-shard-00-02-cl0rt.mongodb.net:27017/admin?replicaSet=M123-Alerts-shard-0 --ssl --username admin --password PASSWORD --quiet atlas_create_backup_data.js


The script will add data to the backup database, and will tell you what timestamp/increment from the oplog that you will want to use when restoring your data.

Then, restore the data, connect to your instance, and count the number of documents in the data collection in the backup database:

use backup
db.data.count()
How many documents are in this collection?

10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
100


Ans : 30
